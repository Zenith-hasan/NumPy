# vector

[1,2,3,4,5]  # Yes, this is array ,list in the python but it's alos called vector.
[[2,3,4,5][3,4,5]] # This is called Matrix

# Matrix can also be written like the following :
[
	[4,5,6]
	[4,5,6]
]

# What you have seen earlied is a 2D (Two Dimentional) Matrix, but martix can be n-dimentionla as well. It's also called n-dimentional data 

# Syntex for the n-dimentional matrices

[
	[4,5,6]
	[6,7,8]
	[7,8,9]
	[2,3,4]
	[1,2,3]
] # This is an example of the 5-dimentional matrices or 5-dimentional data
